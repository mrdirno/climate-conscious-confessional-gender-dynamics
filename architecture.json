  "cover_prompt": "A man and a woman in a sterile, glass-walled apartment, their faces illuminated by the glow of multiple environmental monitors displaying graphs of CO2, methane, and particulate matter, their bodies close yet separated by the cold light of the data screens, one meticulously tending to a wall of air-purifying plants while the other stares blankly at a personal carbon footprint tracker, in a world where the outside air is a visible, amber haze. The scene is set against a panoramic window view of a dystopian cityscape shrouded in permanent smog, with the faint, ghostly outlines of dead forests on distant hills, and the room itself is a paradox of sustainable luxury and clinical detachment, filled with reclaimed wood, biophilic design, and silent, energy-efficient appliances. In the atmospheric style of Ryoji Ikeda's data-driven installations combined with the intimate, psychologically charged domestic scenes of Edward Hopper and the textured, anxious environmental art of Alexis Rockman. Book cover framing, centered composition with a tight, claustrophobic crop that emphasizes the emotional distance between the figures despite their physical proximity, using a dramatic, slightly elevated angle that makes the data screens and the toxic outside world the dominant visual elements. Clinical, cool LED lighting from the monitors clashes with the warm, desperate glow of a single salt lamp, using a palette of desaturated greens, sterile whites, and oppressive amber smog, punctuated by the urgent reds and yellows of warning graphs. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
